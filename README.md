# Stroke Prediction

What if we could take a small amount of information about someone and tell them whether they were likely to have a stroke? Doctors could use a model like this to advise each patient of their risk and steps they could take to lower their odds of such an adverse health event. Using a dataset retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset which contains just over 5,000 patients and eleven features we trained a variety of models in an attempt to optimize recall scores.
